Summary
--------
The goal of this project is to impute missing data, forecast two weeks of sales and to also forecast the sales of a brand new line, with no data on it.

This project was completed primarily in Jupyter Notebooks, with Cookiecutter used to populate the repository. If there were more time this work could be turned into a python package.
